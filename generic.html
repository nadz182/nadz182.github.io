				<p>As a recent grad from Computer Engineering at Birzeit University, I'm always looking for new
					opportunities to grow as a professional. I have started my professional experience in web
					development. I worked as an intern with Laravel framework during my college years. After graduation,
					I worked in networking and security. I have taken part in partnership with Fortinet, which is one of
					the leading network security providers. I installed our different services to several customers,
					where I also provided support and maintenance. At that time, I had passed the Azure Cloud Security
					with Fortinet Products certification exam to prepare the company to be officially announced as a
					fortinet cloud provider. </p>
				<p>I love coding, I really enjoy problem solving, sharing ideas and having the chance to build and
					execute them. And I would love to expand my experience in software engineering, work in a supportive
					environment and drink coffee! </p>
